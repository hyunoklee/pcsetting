I try below tutorial.  

3.Application examples without ROS communication -> 3.1 Import a URDF on Windows
https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki/User_App_NoROS_ImportURDFOnWindows

I can import shadow Hand URDF without any erro.
But I have a problem. when I push play button in Unity. 
I see below erro message. 

1 Inertia tensor must be larger then zero in all coordinates. 
2 UnityEngine.Rigidbody:set_inertiaTensor(Vector3)

Please help me. What can I do more?
Thank you very much.

        {
            Rigidbody _rigidbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();

            if (UseUrdfData)
            {
                _rigidbody.centerOfMass = CenterOfMass;
                _rigidbody.  = InertiaTensor;    ///// Issue is that Inertia tensor must be larger then zero in all coordinates.
